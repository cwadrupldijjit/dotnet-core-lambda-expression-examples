# Dotnet Core Lambda Expressions

### Building and running

You must have Dotnet Core SDK installed on your computer in order to run this project.  I would suggest using the C# extension with VS Code as this example was built with it and as such should just work, but it should still work with any tool that can build and run Dotnet Core.

To run the project, all you need to do is build then start the project in `CoreLambdaExpressions`.  In VS Code, both of those can be done by pressing `F5`.
